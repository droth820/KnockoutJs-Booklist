# KnockoutJs-Booklist
Booklist created with KnockoutJs.
This application was created as part of a project to learn and demonstrate the power of KnockoutJS. In addition to Knockout, I used an animated border menu template made available by:
 * borderMenu.js v1.0.0

 Minimal modifications were made to bordermenu.css to match needs of this project.

To run the application, download the repository to your computer then open the index.html file in your browser. Click the sandwich menu to open the border menu. From there you can click the links to open the pdfs. PDFs are embeded within the html page. I used the ebooks in this app because they were available and convenient. Ebooks were written to supplement lacking course material in my high school physical science class.
